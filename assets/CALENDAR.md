##  Storage

We will choose a database (LevelDB) and write the storage API to manage it and interact with it. This class is also the beginning point for the final project.

## Unit Testing & Middlewares

The writing process will be driven by unit tests.

We'll learn how to use ExpressJS' middlewares, first with existing libraries and then by writing our own middlewares for authentication.

## Production considerations

We'll talk production and the basics of production requirements in the context of a Node.JS application.

We will also see alternative uses of Node.JS.

## Notes

- All of the students' code should be on a git platform
- The class' notation will take in account :
  - Continuous assessment (through git history)
  - A final project
