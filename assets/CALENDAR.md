## Node.JS and Package management

The course starts with a review of the basic knowledge needed for web development. We'll do a brief overview of Node.JS, its usage, strengths and ecosystem with NPM and yarn, and then a quick getting started to get a script up and running introducing the concepts of modules and packages.

We will finally initiate the use of git and GitHub. We'll also cover package best practices to respect Node.JS conventions for packaging with executables dependencies, unit tests and then introduce the use of external libraries.

## ExpressJS & Transpiling

The course will introduce Node.JS frameworks and focus on ExpressJS to write a web application that exposes REST services and renders HTML pages.

The language used across the course such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML can be written in alternative syntaxes. The rest of the course will present and use TypeScript, CoffeeScript, Jade, Stylus and friends.

##  Storage

We will choose a database (LevelDB) and write the storage API to manage it and interact with it. This class is also the beginning point for the final project.

## Unit Testing & Middlewares

The writing process will be driven by unit tests.

We'll learn how to use ExpressJS' middlewares, first with existing libraries and then by writing our own middlewares for authentication.

## Production considerations

We'll talk production and the basics of production requirements in the context of a Node.JS application.

We will also see alternative uses of Node.JS.

## Notes

- All of the students' code should be on a git platform
- The class' notation will take in account :
  - Continuous assessment (through git history)
  - A final project
