# Dependency management & Express

Using the code and repo from last module, convert everything to use `express` 
instead of doing routing and server setup manually. You should have:
  - `/` home page with description 
  - `/hello` page with the button and AJAX request for obtaining metrics

Notes :

This work is part of the continuous assessment of this class and will be the basis for your final project
