# Syllabus

## Introduction

We will cover best practices when developing Node.js programs including API design, package definition, NPM interaction, test coverages and CoffeeScript. Each unit of the course are design to complement each other in the building of a real-life application. We propose to build a time-serie database which collect data from multiple agents, store the data and provide access throuh a web application and a REST api. For example, the result could be used to collect system metrics from a cluster.
