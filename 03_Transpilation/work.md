# Transpilation & storage

Using the code and repo from last weeks TP and enhanced in class, add a `delete`
function to your `metrics` module and a route to delete a batch of metrics based 
on its key. You should already have the `get` function & route from class work.

Also, add to `src/server.ts` the code to expose the front that we had previously 
in the `index.js`

Notes :

This work is part of the continuous assessment of this class and will be the basis for your project
