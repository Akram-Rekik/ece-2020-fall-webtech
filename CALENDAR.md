## Node.js and NPM

The course starts with a review of the basic knowledge needed for web development.
We'll do a brief overview of Node.js, its usage, strengths and ecosystem with 
NPM and then a quick getting started to get a script up and running introducing 
the concepts of modules and packages.
We will finally initiate the use of git and github.

## Packages best practices

We'll see how to respect Node.js convention to package modules with executable
programs, dependencies and unit tests and then introduce the use of external
libraries.

## Transpilers everywhere

The language used across the course such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML can be written
in alternative syntaxes. The rest of the course will present and use CoffeeScript,
Jade, Stylus and friends.

## ExpressJS & Storage

The course will introduce Node.js frameworks and focus on ExpressJS to write a 
web application that exposes REST services and renders HTML pages.

In the second part we'll choose database (LevelDB) and write the storage API to 
manage it and interact with it. The writing process will be driven by unit tests.

This class is also the beginning point for the final project

## Middlewares 

We'll learn how to use ExpressJS' middlewares, first with existing libraries and
then by writing our own middlewares for authenticating.

## Data Streaming with sockets

The course will introduce the web sockets protocol and demonstrate its uses with
a mini-project.

## Notes

* All of the students' code should be on a git platform
* The class' notation will take in account :
  * Continuous assesment (through git history)
  * A written test
  * A final project
